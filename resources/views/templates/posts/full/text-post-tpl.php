      The titles of Washed Out's breakthrough song and the first single from Paracosm share the
      two most important words in Ernest Greene's musical language: feel it. It's a simple request, as well.

    <p>We mentioned Postmatic earlier in the context of wpDiscuz, but itâ€™s more than worth calling out in its own right. Postmatic takes a simple idea and executes it perfectly: it enables users to make use of email-based commenting and subscribe to individual posts.</p>
<p>Postmatic sends an email to commenters with updates on posts they have commented on when new comments are added. Subscribers who wish to add additional comments need only respond via email to have their new comment added to the discussion.</p>
<p>This is an extremely low-friction way of enabling users to continue the conversation and encourages ongoing commenting. The main Postmatic site is also worth a visit to discover more about how you can integrate with existing lists from Jetpack, MailPoet and MailChimp.</p>
